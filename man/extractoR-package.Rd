\title{R packages metadata extractor}
\description{
  extractoR is a R package that can be used to fetch, extract and dump R
  packages metadata from CRAN and GitHub into MongoDB.
}

\details{
  extractoR is composed of the following packages:

  \code{extractoR.cran} contains functions to fetch raw data from
  CRAN. Main functions are used to get the list of available packages,
  download these packages and extract them on local disk. Future
  versions will include mailing list fetching.

  \code{extractoR.github} contains functions to fetch R package
  repositories from Github.

  \code{extractoR.extract} contains functions to extract information
  from R package repositories. Most of those functions return
  \code{data.table} objects.

  \code{extractoR.data} contains functions to read, manipulate and
  export extracted and processed (meta)data.

  \code{extractoR.snapshots} contains functions to read results of "R
  CMD check" commands run on CRAN (see
  http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/). It requires that one manually
  download the files check_flavors.rds, check_details.rds and
  check_results.rds and then store them in a directory which name is
  based on the date of extraction (using the format "%y-%m-%d-%H-%M").
  Ideally this manual extraction should be automated with a cron job to
  keep an history of this check results.

  \code{extractoR.content} browses packages and aggregates informations
  about packages content.
