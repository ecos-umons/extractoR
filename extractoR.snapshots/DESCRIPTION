Description: This package contains functions to read results of "R CMD
             check" commands run on CRAN (see
             http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/). It requires that
             one manually download the files check_flavors.rds,
             check_details.rds and check_results.rds and then store
             them in a directory which name is based on the date of
             extraction (using the format "%y-%m-%d-%H-%M"). Ideally
             this manual extraction should be automated with a cron
             job to keep an history of this check results.
